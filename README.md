# OperationSquirrel
This project is aimed at creating an autonomous drone to defend homes from squirrels.  Advanced control methods, path planning algorithms, localization, and AI/machine learning techniques will be deployed to achieve this goal.  The scope of this project is narrow, but the applications vary widely, as all of the engineering feats that need to be accomplished along the way are stepping stones for other exciting problems.  The work we do for this project can be expanded to defend crops from birds, home security, or any other creative use you can come up with.

`Docs` - instructions on how to set up the workflow and various other things

`SquirrelDefender` - the main application code

`scratch` - miscellaneous experimental code, a sandbox to try out code and save it to the repo
