# Calibration of Object Distances Relative to the Camera

Use this code to create a calibration table to map object sizes to distances relative to the camera, both away from the camera, and to the left and right.

Compile this code and press `ctrl + c` once to start a countdown timer.  At the end of this timer an image will be captured with information about the
detected object overlayed on the image.  The timer allows you time to move into position if you're doing this by yourself.

Press `ctrl + c` 3 times rapidly to exit the program.
